## Architecture

Casbin-dashboard contains 2 parts:

Name | Description | Language | Source code
----|------|----|----
Frontend | Web frontend UI for Casbin-dashboard | Javascript + React + Ant Design | https://github.com/casbin/casbin-dashboard/tree/master/web
Backend | RESTful API backend for Casbin-dashboard | Golang + Beego + MySQL | https://github.com/casbin/casbin-dashboard

## Installation

- Get the code:

```shell
go get github.com/casbin/casbin-dashboard
```

- Setup database:

Casbin-dashboard will store its metadata in a MySQL database named: `casbin_metadata`, will create it if not existed. The DB connection string can be specified at: https://github.com/casbin/casbin-dashboard/blob/master/conf/app.conf

- Setup casbin-dashboard to enable some third-party login platform

Casbin-forum provide a way to sign up using Github account, so you may have to get your own `GithubAuthClientID`, `GithubAuthClientSecret` first.

You could get them by clicking on this url: https://github.com/settings/developers , You should set `Homepage URL` to fit your own domain address, for local testing, set`http://localhost:3000`. And set the Authorization callback URL, the same domain address as `Homepage URL`, for local testing, set`http://localhost:3000`.

- Modified config files:

Change your own `GithubAuthClientID`, `GithubAuthClientSecret` in conf/app.conf, web/src/conf.js.

```ini
dataSourceName = root:123@tcp(localhost:3306)/
```

Casbin-dashboard uses XORM to connect to DB, so all DBs supported by XORM can also be used.

- Run backend (in port 8000):

```
go run main.go
 ```

- Run frontend (in the same machine's port 3030):

```
cd web

```

- Open browser:
